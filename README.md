# Layouter UI

> "Sometimes the most sophisticated solution is the simplest one" - *A British developer, probably*

## What is Layouter?

Layouter is an elegantly minimalist design tool that proves you don't need a Swiss Army knife when a proper English pocket knife will do. While Figma and PenPot might offer you the entire art supply shop, we've distilled interface design down to its purest form: the rectangle.

Yes, you read that correctly. One tool. One shape. Infinite possibilities.

*"But how?"* you might ask, adjusting your monocle. Well, let us explain.

## The Power of Simplicity

Just as a proper cup of tea requires only hot water and tea leaves (milk debate aside), Layouter requires only rectangles to create sophisticated interfaces. After all, what is a modern UI if not a thoughtful arrangement of rectangles? Everything else - colours, rounded corners, shadows - is merely garnish on the architectural feast.

## Three Ways to Layout

Like any good British establishment, we offer you three classes of service:

### üéØ Pure HTML Points
*For the pixel-perfect perfectionist*

The most direct approach - absolute positioning with precise coordinates. Rather like giving directions in London: "Two pixels right from Oxford Street, 48 pixels down from Piccadilly Circus."

```html
<div style="position: absolute; left: 42px; top: 42px;">
  Precisely there, good chap!
</div>
```

### üé® Tailwind Points
*For the utility-class connoisseur*

The same precise positioning, but dressed in Tailwind's finest utility classes. Like ordering your coffee with "tall-42 left-42" instead of giving coordinates.

```html
<div class="absolute left-[42px] top-[42px]">
  Quite dashing, wouldn't you say?
</div>
```

### üìê Grid System
*For the architectural enthusiast*

Our most sophisticated approach, featuring proper DOM tree construction with sections, containers, and grids. Rather like planning a proper English garden - everything in its right place, properly structured and perfectly aligned.

## Integration with Buildy

Here's where things get properly clever: Layouter isn't just a design tool - it's a bridge to implementation. Draw your interface, and Buildy (our companion tool) will match your rectangles with relevant shadcn/ui components faster than you can say "God Save the Queen."

Think of it as having a very efficient butler who knows exactly which component you need based on your architectural sketches.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository (in a very civilised manner)
git clone https://github.com/alexy-os/layouter.git

# Enter the premises
cd layouter

# Install dependencies (with a cup of tea in hand)
npm install
```

## Why Just Rectangles?

As G.K. Chesterton might have said (if he were a UI designer): "The rectangle is not a limitation; it is an opportunity. The rectangle is not a constraint; it is a foundation."

Consider:
- A button? A rectangle with rounded corners
- A card? A rectangle with a shadow
- A header? A rather wide rectangle
- A modal? A rectangle with a fancy entrance
- A sidebar? Oh, you know where this is going
