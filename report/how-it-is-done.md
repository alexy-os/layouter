# Layouter UI - The Story of a Project from Concept to PoC (Proof of Concept)

## How was this project implemented within a single sprint (session)?
> PM + Claude Sonnet 3.5 in AI-agent mode (Cursor AI)

Let's analyze our sprint for creating Layouter:

1. Actual development time:
- We started from scratch and went through the path to a working prototype (PoC) with core functionality
- We implemented:
  - The basic structure of the application
  - The layer system
  - Drawing tools
  - Element properties
  - The pattern system
  - Import/export
  - Validation
  - Dark theme
  - Adaptive UI

2. Comparison with the studio's estimate:
- In a studio, this would have taken 20-26 working days (4-5.5 weeks)
- We, however, completed the basic functionality within a single session (5.5-8 hours)
- This was possible due to:
  - A clear product vision
  - The use of ready-made solutions (Tailwind)
  - The absence of bureaucracy
  - Rapid decision-making
  - Focus on MVP functionality

3. Key factors of efficiency:
- The use of modern tools
- - Claude Sonnet 3.5 in AI-agent mode (Cursor AI)
- - Tailwind CSS (cdn)
- - GitHub Repository
- - Vercel Development

- A clear architecture from the beginning
- A modular approach to development
- Fast iteration and error correction in AI-agent mode
- The absence of the need for approvals

4. What we omitted from "studio-style" development:
- Formal design
- Detailed testing
- Documentation
- UI/UX research
- Performance optimization
- Cross-browser testing

This is an excellent example of how to quickly create a working prototype when you have:
1. A clear understanding of the product UI/UX
2. The right tools chosen
3. Experience in developing similar solutions
4. The ability to make quick decisions

However, for a production version, it would still be necessary to go through all the stages of the full development cycle, including testing, optimization, and documentation, including code review and manual testing.

## How would a web studio with 3 employees implement this project?

Let's break down the project into stages and estimate the typical labor costs for a team of 3 people:

1. Pre-project preparation (2 days):
- Product Manager: 
  - Market and competitor analysis (6 hours)
  - Formation of basic requirements (6 hours)
- Designer:
  - Reference search (6 hours)
  - UI/UX pattern analysis (6 hours)
- Frontend:
  - Technical capabilities assessment (6 hours)
  - Technology stack selection (6 hours)

2. Design (3 days):
- Product Manager:
  - Detailed requirements specification (6 hours)
  - Description of user scenarios (12 hours)
- Designer:
  - Creation of basic UI components (12 hours)
  - Prototyping of main screens (6 hours)
- Frontend:
  - Architecture design (12 hours)
  - Creation of the project's basic structure (6 hours)

3. MVP development (5 days):
- Frontend:
  - Basic application structure (6 hours)
  - Implementation of canvas and tools (12 hours)
  - Layer system (12 hours)
- Designer:
  - UI components and styles (18 hours)
  - Animations and transitions (12 hours)
- Product Manager:
  - Coordination and testing (30 hours)

4. Core functionality (7 days):
- Frontend:
  - Pattern system (12 hours)
  - Import/export (12 hours)
  - Validation and error handling (12 hours)
  - Refactoring and optimization (6 hours)
- Designer:
  - UI/UX refinement (24 hours)
  - Style documentation (18 hours)
- Product Manager:
  - Testing and feedback (24 hours)
  - Documentation (18 hours)

5. Final polishing (3 days):
- Frontend:
  - Bug fixing (12 hours)
  - Performance optimization (6 hours)
- Designer:
  - Final UI adjustments (12 hours)
  - Asset preparation (6 hours)
- Product Manager:
  - Final testing (12 hours)
  - Release preparation (6 hours)

Total: 20 working days (4 weeks)

Total labor costs by role:
- Product Manager: 114 hours
- Frontend developer: 102 hours
- Designer: 94 hours

Total team labor costs: 310 hours

Important notes:
1. This is an estimate for creating a stable production-ready version
2. The calculation includes:
   - Daily stand-up meetings
   - Code review
   - Testing
   - Documentation
3. Not included:
   - Marketing preparation
   - Infrastructure deployment
   - Post-release support

In reality, the timelines may increase due to:
- Changes in requirements
- Unforeseen technical complexities
- Vacations/sick leaves
- Communication delays
- The need for approvals

It is recommended to add a 25-30% buffer to the timelines to account for unforeseen circumstances, which would give a final estimate of 25-26 working days (5-5.5 weeks).
